        <p>After 48 hours following surgery</p>
        <h3>When can the wound sutures be removed?</h3>
        <p>Usually, sutures do not require removal and slowly disintegrate on their own until they disappear. However, if there are any visible sutures, they are removed during the first visit in the follow up clinic two weeks following surgery.</p>
        <h3>How is wound dressing done?</h3>
        <p>The first wound dressing is done 48 hours following surgery by exposing wounds and applying betadine using sterile gauze until dry and are left exposed. This is repeated for the next 5 days, once daily.</p>

        <h3>What is the expected pain following surgery?</h3>
        <p>
            Pain is expected to last for 48 hours following surgery and then gradually subsides.
            You may intermittently experience pain in your tummy, your shoulders or tingling in your legs. If it is accompanied with other symptoms such as fever or vomiting please contact the surgical team
        </p>
        <p>Pain in the wound at the left side of your tummy is likely to last a little longer and may increase on doing muscular effort in this area such as during coughing or sneezing. You can take one intramuscular analgesic (Ketolac injection) if needed.</p>
        <img src="../images/postsurgery/ketolacinjection.jpg" alt="Ketolac Injection" />
        <h3>Vomiting</h3>
        <p>Vomiting may happen during the first 48 hours following surgery.</p>
        <p>You may experience temporary attacks of vomiting if you eat in a hasty/quick manner, in large amounts, if you eat unhealthy food or if you do not follow the described nutrition regimen. In such a case, you have to rest your stomach and drink fluids only until symptoms subside then you can reintroduce food gradually. Primperan intravenous injection may be used if needed.</p>
