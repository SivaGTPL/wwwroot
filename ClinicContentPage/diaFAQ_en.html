        <div class="panel">
            <p>The duration of the operation ranges between 45 to 60 minutes.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What is the appropriate age for the operation? </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>There is no specific age for performing obesity surgeries, provided that the requirements for performing the surgery are available in terms of body mass index (weight) and medical problems in a manner that does not pose a threat to the patient's health, with full understanding of the details of the operation and the diet followed before and after surgery and approval of it, and this includes children and the elderly.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What is the difference between local “regional” anesthesia and general anesthesia? </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> In local anesthesia, the patient is awake during the surgery, only the intended part of the surgery is anesthetized. In general anesthesia, the patient is in a state of anesthesia for the entire body, similar to deep sleep, with the help of a device to regulate breathing “mechanical ventilation”. </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What is the difference between Regional and spinal anesthesia?  </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>In Regional anesthesia for bariatric surgery, the entire abdominal area is anesthetized, including the upper abdomen (the intended area for obesity surgery). As for spinal anesthesia, it can be used for surgeries of the lower part of the abdominal area only, such as caesarean section and inguinal hernia repair. </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What determines the type of operation? </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>A comprehensive assessment of the patient’s medical condition is performed by visiting the clinic before surgery, and based on that, the appropriate surgery for the patient can be chosen, which differs from one person to another. Among the factors on which the appropriate type of surgery is selected are: Does the patient suffer from GERD or not? Does the patient have a craving for sugars and sweets? Does the patient suffer from diabetes or not? How long? What is its response to blood sugar lowering drugs? </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Does the operation have side effects?  </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Several factors have led to considering bariatric surgeries relatively safe, such as the wide spread of bariatric surgeries and the development of surgical instruments, starting from the laparoscope to robotic interventions. Also, the risks of obesity and its associated diseases outweighs the possible side effects of bariatric surgery</p>

Also, the risks of obesity and its associated diseases outweighs the possible side effects of bariatric surgery</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Robotic intervention allows a three-dimensional view with a magnified image of about 15 times and offers movements that mimic the movements of the surgeon's hand, which allows the surgeon to have better control and perform procedures that were not possible with a traditional laparoscope. </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Does the robot can also be used for gastric bypass or just for sleeve gastrectomy?  </button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The robotic approach is a surgical tool and can be used to perform many surgeries. </p>

                The two operations share the need of the patient to adhere to a healthy lifestyle after recovery to maintain the desired result mainly by reducing the calories gained and exercising. But the need to take vitamins is at least a year after the gastric sleeve and continuously after gastric bypass.
            </p>
